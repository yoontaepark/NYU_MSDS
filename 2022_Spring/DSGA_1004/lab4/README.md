## Part 1. Dask and Jupyter on Greene

In this assignment, we will be using Dask to analyze data on the Greene Cluster.

### Logging into Greene

To set up this assignment, you will need to clone this project's git repository onto the Greene cluster.

Logging into Greene works just like logging into the Peel cluster, but if you need a refresher, please consult the [HPC documentation](https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/documentation/hpc-access).

Once you are logged into the Greene cluster, clone this repository using the git command-line:

```bash
git clone <YOUR PROJECT REPOSITORY URL>
```

### Launching Jupyter on Greene

The Greene cluster allows you to run Jupyter-lab directly on the compute nodes.
Doing this requires that you're either on the NYU network, or connected via the
[virtual private network
(VPN)](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/network-and-connectivity/vpn.html).

Once you are on the NYU network, go to https://ood.hpc.nyu.edu and login with your
NYU credentials.

At the top of the page, you will see a menu titled *Interactive Apps▾*, and within
that menu, an entry for **DS-GA.1004 - Jupyter Dask**.

Following this link will take you to a screen to start the dask-enabled Jupyter-lab
server.  For this assignment, you should not need more than 1 core -- this refers to
the number of cores used by the notebook, not the distributed computation executed
by dask -- and 4GB of main memory.  When you have configured your session, click the
**Launch** button.

When the Jupyter session is ready, you will see a button **Connect to Jupyter** that
will take you to the active session.


### Running a basic dask computation

In this repository, you will find two notebooks: `Dask starter.ipynb` and `GHCN
analysis.ipynb`.
The first notebook (`Dask starter`) implements some of the examples that we've seen
in class.
Step through this example notebook and make sure that you understand what each piece
is doing before moving on to part 2.

Note that in the starter notebook, all execution is performed by a local dask
client running on the same machine as your Jupyter session.
In the next section, you'll see how to configure a dask client which uses multiple
compute nodes on the cluster for larger jobs.


## Part 2. Bags and DataFrames

In this part, you will use Dask DataFrames to process a large collection of climate data.

### The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) Data

The [GHCN
dataset](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861)
consists of daily summaries of climate data (temperature, precipitation, etc) measured
across the globe.

The full dataset is mirrored on the Greene cluster, and can be located at:

```
/scratch/work/courses/DSGA1004-2021/ghcnd_all/
```

Two smaller versions of the data are also provided, which you can use for
development purposes:

- `/scratch/work/courses/DSGA1004-2021/ghcnd_tiny/`
- `/scratch/work/courses/DSGA1004-2021/ghcnd_small/`


The data consists of around 118,000 files, totalling to about 37 gigabytes.
All files follow a text-based format, described [in the
documentation](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt)
(see section III).

A representative example file looks as follows:
```
ACW00011604194901TMAX  289  X  289  X  283  X  283  X  289  X  289  X  278  X  267  X  272  X  278  X  267  X  278  X  267  X  267  X  278  X  267  X  267  X  272  X  272  X  272  X  278  X  272  X  267  X  267  X  267  X  278  X  272  X  272  X  272  X  272  X  272  X
ACW00011604194901TMIN  217  X  228  X  222  X  233  X  222  X  222  X  228  X  217  X  222  X  183  X  189  X  194  X  161  X  183  X  178  X  222  X  211  X  211  X  194  X  217  X  217  X  217  X  211  X  211  X  200  X  222  X  217  X  211  X  222  X  206  X  217  X
ACW00011604194901PRCP    0  X   30  X    0  X    0  X   25  X   41  X    0  X    0T X    0  X    0  X   56  X    0T X    8  X    0  X    0  X    0  X    0  X    0T X    3  X    0T X   51  X    0  X   53  X    0  X   10  X   15  X   41  X    0T X   86  X   28  X   15  X
...
```
Each row consists of a month's worth of measurements.
The first field encodes the measurement station identifier (in this case,
`ACW00011604`), the year and month (`1949`, `01`), and the quantity being
measured: maximum temperature (`TMAX`), minimum temperature (`TMIN`),
precipitation (`PRCP`), and so on.
The remaining data points consist of measurement numbers (e.g., temperature
in tenths of a degree centigrade), and three measurement flags.

This data format is not a widely used standard (CSV, Parquet, etc), but we provide a function (`load_daily`) to parse these data files into Python dictionaries to get you started.
**Do not modify the `load_daily` function.**
With the example file above, the result of parsing is a list of per-day
observations:
```python
>>> load_daily('ACW00011604.dly')
[{'station_id': 'ACW00011604',
  'year': 1949,
  'month': 1,
  'element': 'TMAX',
  'day': 1,
  'value': 289,
  'measurement': ' ',
  'quality': ' ',
  'source': 'X'},
 {'station_id': 'ACW00011604',
  'year': 1949,
  'month': 1,
  'element': 'TMAX',
  'day': 2,
  'value': 289,
  'measurement': ' ',
  'quality': ' ',
  'source': 'X'},
 {'station_id': 'ACW00011604',
  'year': 1949,
  'month': 1,
  'element': 'TMAX',
  'day': 3,
  'value': 283,
  'measurement': ' ',
  'quality': ' ',
  'source': 'X'},
  ...
```

### Interpreting the data

Each month (row of input data) contains 31 days worth of observations, so
that all rows have the same length (in characters).
**But not all months have 31 days!**
Days with missing observations (e.g., April 31 or February 30) are
represented as having `value = -9999`.
These days should be discarded from any analysis you do!

Additionally, there are three "flag" fields in each observation:
`measurement`, `quality`, and `source`.
- The `measurement` field includes information about how data was collected
(e.g., was it aggregated over 6- or 12-hour periods, whether it was
converted from some other units, etc).
- The `source` field encodes the original source (e.g., various national
  weather agencies) of the measurement data, as GHCN is compiled from multiple other datasets.
- The `quality` field encodes whether this observation failed a data
  validation check.  If `quality` consists of a single blank space (`quality
  == ' '`), the data is presumed "good".

For this assignment, you should retain only the data that passed previous
quality checks.

### What to do and turn in

- Using dask bags and dataframes, compute the mean precipitation (PRCP) and maximum daily temprature (TMAX) across all stations, aggregated per year.
  Specifically, you should report the annual mean of `PRCP`, and `TMAX` each separately.

- Repeat this analysis for each version of the data: `ghcnd_tiny`, `ghcnd_small`, and `ghcnd_all`.  
  Save your results separately for each version, e.g., `tmax-tiny.csv`, `tmax-small.csv`, `tmax-all.csv` (and similarly for `PRCP`).
  **Remember to commit these results to the repository and include them in your submission!**

- In `REPORT.md`, include a brief summary description of your solution (1--2 paragraphs).  Answer the following questions:
    - What strategies did you use to optimize the computation for the full set?
    - Did you try any alternative implementations that didn't work, or didn't work as well?  If so, how did this change your approach?
    - Did you encounter any unexpected behavior?
    
- When you have completed the above tasks, be sure to commit all results and the report document to git, and push the results back up to GitHub to submit your project.


## General tips

- Start with a very small subset of input files (say, `ghcnd_tiny/*`) so that you can quickly develop and test your solution.
- Start with a local Dask client (threaded execution) before moving to cluster-based execution.
- Before going to the full set, also run on `ghcnd_small/` to verify that your solution works.
- Get familiar with the [Dask documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/).
- Try to avoid propagating data that won't be necessary for your final computation.  Filter your data as early as you can in the computation graph.
- Experiment with different partitioning strategies to maintain a balanced workload on the cluster.
- When running in cluster mode, you might want to start a terminal through jupyter-lab and monitor the worker outputs.  These will be stored as text files `/scratch/YOURNETID/slurm-XXXXXXXX.out`.
- There's more than one way to do this assignment!  Experiment with different ways of implementing filtering and aggregation.  How fast can you make this run?
